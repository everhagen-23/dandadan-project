        <dialogue who="Momo">Come on, comfort me! He was my first boyfriend.</dialogue>
        <dialogue who="Muko">That's why I told you to not go for him. What was so good about him,
            anyway?</dialogue>
        <dialogue who="Momo">He looked like Ken Takakura. </dialogue>
        <dialogue who="Muko">-Oh, there you go. -You're so annoying.</dialogue>

        <dialogue who="Momo">Nothing wrong with that! I like masculine guys like Ken
            Takakura!</dialogue>
        <dialogue who="Muko">"I am an awkward fellow, after all." Dudes like that are

    <location place="hallway"><dialogue who="Momo">How lame. Do only scum live in this world? Man,
            I've had enough. Where can I relieve all this stress?</dialogue>
        <dialogue who="Ken"> Miss Momo Ayase! -I know you're in love!</dialogue>
        <dialogue who="Momo">-Huh? </dialogue>
        <dialogue who="Ken">I know you're in love! </dialogue>
        <dialogue who="Momo">How many times you gonna say that? </dialogue>
        <dialogue who="Ken">Someone like Miss Ayase talking to me? That's gotta be the only
            reason!</dialogue>
        <dialogue who="Momo"> Maybe you got the wrong idea? It's not like I wanna get chummy with
            you or anything. Forget all that earlier.</dialogue>
        <dialogue who="Ken">This is what I'm talking about! </dialogue>
        <p on="magazine">The President has already gone to Mars! What is the entirety of Project
            Pegasus?!</p>
        <dialogue who="Momo">Huh? What? </dialogue> You're a fan of the occult! <dialogue who="Momo"
            >Oh, I don't believe in UFOs or aliens or stuff like that.</dialogue>
        <dialogue who="Ken">I'm not talking about a UFO, but a UAP! Unidentified Aerial
            Phenomena!</dialogue>
        <dialogue who="Momo">Hey, you're being a pest. </dialogue>
        <dialogue who="Ken">The U.S. military has officially acknowledged the existence of UAPs and
            reformed the Space Force! Japan has also newly created an Aerospace Self-Defense Force!
            Any way you look at it, they're getting ready for Space Wars!</dialogue>
        <dialogue who="Momo">Can I go now? </dialogue>
        <dialogue who="Ken">What? No, wait! This has the newest image of Nessie, too. Here! It also
            talks about Lieutenant Colonel Jim Channon and Skinwalker Ranch!</dialogue>
        <dialogue who="Momo">Shut up! I just got dumped so I don't want any of this. How you push
            stuff at me is so typical of otaku and really annoying! That's why you have no friends!
            Don't talk to me like you know me. Sorry, that was a bit much.</dialogue>
        <p on="magazine">YOUR TRUE POWERS AND POTENTIAL HAVE YET TO AWAKEN…</p>
        <dialogue who="Momo"> Here. I don't believe in aliens. But I do believe in
            ghosts.</dialogue>
        <dialogue who="Ken">Oh no, there's no such thing as ghosts. </dialogue>
        <dialogue who="Momo">I matched the conversation topic to yours, but you outright deny that?!
            Don't you mock the occult! Just so you know, my grandma is a spirit medium.</dialogue>
        <dialogue who="Ken">What? </dialogue>
        <dialogue who="Momo">Have you ever seen an exorcism? It's really wicked! The possessed
            person goes into convulsions! You can go into convulsions from illness, too.</dialogue>
        <dialogue who="Ken">It's not proof that ghosts are out there. </dialogue>
        <dialogue who="Momo">Then have you ever had an alien let you ride a UFO?!</dialogue>
        <dialogue who="Ken">Your logic is jumping too far! Are you an idiot?!</dialogue>
        <dialogue who="Muko">Huh? She gave up on Ken Takakura and went after an otaku?</dialogue>
        <dialogue who="Miko">Look. It's like she doesn't care what other people would
            think.</dialogue>
        <dialogue who="Muko">Can't say I hate it. </dialogue>
        <dialogue who="Momo">Then let's have a contest, dammit! If there really are ghosts, you'll
            be serving me as a gofer!</dialogue>
        <dialogue who="Ken">I'll show you UFOs, I mean, UAPs! If you're able to see one, M-Miss
            Ayase, you'll be my gofer instead!</dialogue></location>

        <p on="sign">NAGI GENERAL HOSPITAL</p>
        <dialogue who="Momo">What is this place? It's way too scary! What part of this is a UFO
            hotspot? </dialogue>
        <dialogue who="Ken">They call that Nagi Hospital a sanctuary for UFOs! If you call for a UFO
            on the roof, you will experience an Abduction!</dialogue>
        <dialogue who="Momo">What's an Abduction? </dialogue>
        <dialogue who="Ken">That's when an alien kidnaps you and experiments with your
            body.</dialogue>
        <dialogue who="Momo"> Wait, hold on! Have you been experimented on before?!</dialogue>
        <dialogue who="Ken">There is a chance that I have! </dialogue>
        <dialogue who="Momo">Huh? </dialogue>
        <dialogue who="Ken">Many people who experience an Abduction have their memories
            erased.</dialogue>
        <dialogue who="Momo">Hey, you. You've never seen a UFO before, have you?</dialogue>
        <dialogue who="Ken">Do you know about regressive hypnosis? </dialogue>
        <dialogue who="Momo">Don't change the subject on me. </dialogue>
        <dialogue who="Ken">It's not an issue of whether or not you've seen one! The point is
            whether or not there's proper proof that they exist! </dialogue>
        <dialogue who="Momo">Shut up! Anyway, how are things on your end?</dialogue></location>
    <location place="tunnel">
        <p on="sign">KEEP OUT </p><dialogue who="Ken">I have arrived. At the spiritual hotspot. Now,
            I'll go and prove it right now… that there are no such things as ghosts!</dialogue>
        <dialogue who="Momo">Hey, you aren't freaking out, are you? By the way, that spot is famous
            on the 'net for something definitely being there.</dialogue>
        <dialogue who="Ken">Too shy, shy boy, in this moment! </dialogue>
        <dialogue who="Momo">They say speaking loudly is the most dangerous thing to do.</dialogue>
        <dialogue who="Ken">Too shy, shy boy… </dialogue>
        <dialogue who="Momo">On the 'net. </dialogue>
        <dialogue who="Ken">You've been mentioning the 'net a lot. So have you seen a ghost, Miss
            Ayase?</dialogue></location>
    <location place="hospital">
        <dialogue who="Momo">Nope. </dialogue>
        <dialogue who="Ken">What? How dare you talk so authoritatively earlier!</dialogue>
        <dialogue who="Momo">My bad! </dialogue>
        <dialogue who="Ken">Take back that attitude you've been giving me! It's absurd that you've
            never seen a ghost but believe in them!</dialogue>
        <dialogue who="Momo">It's not absurd. I told you my grandma's a spirit medium. I love my
            grandma a lot since I don't have parents.</dialogue>
        <dialogue who="Ken">Oh, I see. </dialogue>
        <dialogue who="Momo">Why are you getting all meek and stuff? Get a load of this. My family
            is seriously weird.</dialogue></location><location place="school"><dialogue who="Momo">
            I always had to perform a good luck ritual before stepping outside. I was always forced
            to do it the entire way to school. And of course, I was the laughingstock of all the
            boys. If I don't do it, Grandma got pissed. It was the pits. But the toughest part of it
            all… was when the boy I liked made fun of me. I really hated my grandma. "Because of
            that weird ritual, the boy I like hates me." I think I said something horrible like that
            to Grandma.</dialogue></location><location place="hospital"><dialogue who="Momo"> Since
            then, I didn't talk to Grandma until recently, and I stopped doing the ritual. But you
            know, I get pissed when someone else makes fun of my family. That's when I realized…
        </dialogue></location><location place="ayaseHome"><dialogue who="Momo">I didn't hate the
            fact that the boy I liked didn't like me. I hated the fact that the boy I liked made fun
            of my grandma. In reality, I loved both Grandma and her job as a spirit medium, because
            it felt special. How she decided to take me in, and lovingly raised me all by herself… I
            have faith in my grandma.</dialogue></location>
    <location place="hospital">
        <dialogue who="Momo"> That's why I believe in ghosts. So anyway, why do you believe in
            aliens?</dialogue></location>
    <location place="tunnel">
        <dialogue who="Ken">That really doesn't matter, right? </dialogue>
    </location>
    <location place="hospital">
        <dialogue who="Momo">What's with that? You don't have any reasons? Do you need a reason to
            like something? Well, you have a point. More like, Occult-kun, you sure talk bluntly
            over the phone.</dialogue></location>
<location place="tunnel">    <dialogue who="Ken">I-Is that so? Miss Ayase, you're pretty easy to talk to.</dialogue>
    <dialogue who="turboGranny">I'll let you suckle my teats, so… lemme gobble that
        weenie.</dialogue>
    <dialogue who="Ken">Ghost!</dialogue>
    <dialogue who="Momo">Hold on! You shouldn't run there! Hey, Occult-kun!</dialogue>
    <dialogue who="Ken">No way! Impossible! -That was just an ordinary granny!</dialogue>
    <dialogue who="Momo">-Oc… kun… -Stop right now!</dialogue>
    <dialogue who="Ken">-That's it. -Just an ordinary granny!</dialogue>
    <dialogue who="Momo">-They say on the 'net she's bad news! </dialogue>
    <dialogue who="Ken">I'm pretty sure I misunderstood something. I simply bumped into a lewd
        granny!</dialogue>
    <dialogue who="Momo"> They say you can't let her outrun you at any cost! If you lose a race
        against Turbo Granny, you'll be cursed! Hey, Occult-kun! Are you listening? Hello? Answer
        me! You're kidding me, right?</dialogue></location><location place="hospital"><dialogue who="Momo"> I'll head over there right now! Just hang on! What are those
        things? Seriously, cut it out.</dialogue></location>
    <dialogue who="Rokuro">Hello, woman person. We are Serpoians. We are called that because we come
        from the planet Serpo.</dialogue>
    <dialogue who="Momo">Aliens? </dialogue>
    <dialogue who="Rokuro">Don't be afraid. We are a friendly people. </dialogue>
    <dialogue who="Momo">Friendly guys don't strip girls naked, you know! Where are my
        clothes?</dialogue>
    <dialogue who="Rokuro">We have taken proper care of your belongings.</dialogue>
    <dialogue who="Momo">They're all tattered! Pay for damages! And I wanna go home, so can you take
        this off?</dialogue>
    <dialogue who="Rokuro"> Our kind only has males. Thus, we reproduce through clone technology. </dialogue>
    <dialogue who="Momo">Are you even listening? </dialogue>
    <dialogue who="Rokuro">However, identical units do not instigate biological evolution. Conflict,
        as well as basic emotions, were annihilated. Therefore, for us to regain reproductive
        function similar to humans, we want your "bananas." We will now have sex. After having sex
        with you, we will extract your uterus and your banana for research.</dialogue>
    <dialogue who="Momo">Gimme a break! I did date a douchebag, but I didn't let him take my
        virginity! My chastity has been saved for a Ken Takakura I have yet to meet! No way some
        creepy alien is gonna take it from me! </dialogue>
    <dialogue who="Rokuro">In order to arouse your desire, we will use psychokinesis to control your
        brain waves. How is it? Isn't the temperature of your body getting warmer? What's this? She
        is resisting the psychokinesis. What incredible spiritual power. However… Let us
        begin.</dialogue>
    <dialogue who="Momo">No… Stop!</dialogue>
    <dialogue who="Rokuro">A phone call? Someone sure has a really bad sense of timing.</dialogue>
    <dialogue who="Ken">Miss Ayase! I'm sorry! There was a ghost! Turbo Granny has cursed
        me!</dialogue>
    <dialogue who="Momo">Occult-kun! I'm glad! Can you help me?</dialogue>
    <dialogue who="Rokuro">Who are you? Infiltrating using a smartphone. Not even we have technology
        like that.</dialogue>
    <dialogue who="cursedKen">Please help! I can't control myself! </dialogue>
    <dialogue who="turboGranny">Lemme gobble that weenie!</dialogue>
    <dialogue who="Momo">Come on, get a grip! </dialogue>
    <dialogue who="Rokuro">Man person over there. We did not authorize your intrusion. Leave
        immediately, or else… Please give us your banana.</dialogue>
    <dialogue who="Momo">Gross</dialogue>! <dialogue who="Rokuro">Six Sense Organs! So fast! I
        cannot set my psychokinesis. Our cherished bananas! You banana thief! Serpoian Form
        Serpo-Grammetry!</dialogue>
    <dialogue who="Momo">Occult-kun! </dialogue>
    <dialogue who="Rokuro">We have never encountered someone so aggressive. We have an amiable
        relationship with humans. So give us your bananas. </dialogue>
    <dialogue who="Ken">I'll give it to you! Anything if it's mine! I've been wanting to see aliens
        for the longest time! Because I didn't have any friends, I thought at least aliens would be
        my friends. I've been calling to the skies for a UFO since grade school! But you never came!
        No matter how much I called for you, you never showed up! Other humans bullied me to pass
        their time. Aliens didn't give me the time of day. Nobody ever acknowledged my existence.
        But Miss Ayase…. She actually stood up for me, despite that! So don't you lay a finger on
        her! I won't allow anyone to hurt her! If it's for her sake, I'll even become a
        monster!</dialogue>
    <dialogue who="Momo">Keep at it, Occult-kun! Show 'em what a man you are!</dialogue>
    <dialogue who="Rokuro">Fie</dialogue>! <dialogue who="Ken"> Miss Ayase… It looks impossible
        after all.</dialogue>
    <dialogue who="Momo"> You gave up really fast there! </dialogue>
    <dialogue who="Rokuro">We cannot become friends with a violent person like you. Besides, we like
        woman persons more than man persons. Now, once again, I shall arouse your desire.</dialogue>
    <dialogue who="Seiko">Take your chi out. </dialogue>
    <dialogue who="kidMomo">I don't wanna. My friends make fun of me every single day because of
        that.</dialogue>
    <dialogue who="Seiko"> What are you talking about? If you have your chi out, you won't get hurt
        or sick. Bad things can't get near you. First, firm up your lower abs. Imagine having your
        chi shoot up from the top of your head.</dialogue>
    <dialogue who="Extra">She's doing it again! </dialogue>
    <dialogue who="Extra">Is she communicating with aliens or something?</dialogue>
    <dialogue who="kidMomo">I hate it! I'm never doing it again! </dialogue>
    <dialogue who="Seiko">Momo! Hold on! </dialogue>
    <dialogue who="kidMomo">I hate you, Grandma! You fake spirit medium!</dialogue>
    <dialogue who="Momo">Why am I remembering the past right now? I'm sorry, Grandma. I just felt
        embarrassed back then.</dialogue>
    <dialogue who="Seiko">Firm up your lower abs. Chi shoot up from the top of your head.</dialogue>
    <dialogue who="Momo">No way! What?</dialogue>
    <dialogue who="Ken">Miss Ayase, you can use psychic powers? </dialogue>
    <dialogue who="Momo">Well, I'm surprised by that myself! </dialogue>
    <dialogue who="Rokuro">Unbelievable! My psychokinesis is being pushed back! Why? Did I stimulate
        her brain waves too much and cause the woman person's chakra to open up?</dialogue>
    <dialogue who="Momo"> She was for real. Grandma was a real spirit medium! Thank you, Grandma!
        With this, I can take those scumbags… and send them flying! What is this? That was a UFO?
        Occult-kun, are you okay? Let's get outta here! Ow! What are you doing, idiot! Regain your
        sanity already! Damn you! Turbo Granny?</dialogue>
    <dialogue who="turboGranny">Who the hell are you? </dialogue>
    <dialogue who="Momo">His curse hasn't lifted! Granny is out of his body, though!</dialogue>
    <dialogue who="turboGranny"> I have possession of that kid's weenie. As long as I have his
        weenie, that kid's curse won't be lifted. If you want it back, come to the tunnel. This
        place is too far for me. I'll take you on as much as you want if it's in the tunnel, gaudy
        hag.</dialogue>
    <dialogue who="Momo"> Who you calling a gaudy hag, you old bag of crap! Give him back his
        thingy! Crap! If we don't escape, we're gonna die! Get a grip, you idiot! We're gonna
        escape! This is the worst. I'll believe in aliens. Like, I was kidnapped and all.</dialogue>
    <dialogue who="Ken"> I'll believe in ghosts, too. I got cursed after all.</dialogue>
    <dialogue who="Momo">So, what should we do from here? </dialogue>
    <dialogue who="Ken">What should we do? </dialogue>
    <dialogue who="Momo">You lose control of yourself if I don't hold the curse back with psychic
        powers.</dialogue>
    <dialogue who="Ken">I'm sorry. </dialogue>
    <dialogue who="Momo">I lost my uniform, my wallet, my smartphone. Everything.</dialogue>
    <dialogue who="Ken">How can I lift this curse? </dialogue>
    <dialogue who="Momo">You have to beat the crap out of Turbo Granny. She's the cause of the
        curse.</dialogue>
    <dialogue who="Ken">I see. Then I'll head on over there. </dialogue>
    <dialogue who="Momo">Huh? Right now? </dialogue>
    <dialogue who="Ken">Miss Ayase, please wear my clothes back home.</dialogue>
    <dialogue who="Momo">Hold on! You'll lose control without me! </dialogue>
    <dialogue who="Ken">All of this happened because of what I did. I can't get you involved in it
        anymore, Miss Ayase. I'll use willpower to make it to the tunnel, and then make it work
        somehow.</dialogue>
    <dialogue who="Momo">Why can't you ask me to come with you? After that experience earlier, I
        can't leave you alone! You would've died earlier if I wasn't around!</dialogue>
    <dialogue who="Ken"> Is it okay for you to help someone like me?</dialogue>
    <dialogue who="Momo">Stuff like that is such a hassle. Come on, put some clothes on. Let's go! </dialogue>
    <dialogue who="Ken">I'm sorry. I am an awkward fellow, after all. Miss Ayase, please put some
        clothes on. If you don't, I can't bring myself to speak properly.</dialogue>
    <dialogue who="Momo"> No way. Why is my heart racing? This can't be. I was just surprised
        because he happened to recite one of Ken Takakura's lines. I need to calm down for now. By
        the way, what's your name? I'm terrible at remembering names. Oh? Um…</dialogue>
    <dialogue who="Ken">I'm Ken Takakura. </dialogue>
    <dialogue who="Momo">Aliens really did exist! </dialogue>
    <dialogue who="Ken">Ghosts exist, too! The existence of aliens and ghosts being proven means
        that there's a possibility of supernatural phenomena, UMA, and all other things that were
        said to be absurd can be proven as well.</dialogue>
    <dialogue who="Momo">Oh, fine, I get it! Ready. </dialogue></episode>
